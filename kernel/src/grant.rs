//! Support for processes granting memory from their allocations to the kernel.
//!
//!
//!
//! ## Grant Overview
//!
//! Grants allow capsules to dynamically allocate memory from a process to hold
//! state on the process's behalf.
//!
//! Each capsule that wishes to do this needs to have a `Grant` type. `Grant`s
//! are created at boot, and each have a unique ID and a type `T`. This type
//! only allows the capsule to allocate memory from a process in the future. It
//! does not initially represent any allocated memory.
//!
//! When a capsule does wish to use its `Grant` to allocate memory from a
//! process, it must "enter" the `Grant` with a specific `ProcessId`. Entering a
//! `Grant` for a specific process instructs the core kernel to create an object
//! `T` in the process's memory space and provide the capsule with access to it.
//! If the `Grant` has not previously been entered for that process, the memory
//! for object `T` will be allocated from the "grant region" within the
//! kernel-accessible portion of the process's memory.
//!
//! If a `Grant` has never been entered for a process, the object `T` will _not_
//! be allocated in that process's grant region, even if the `Grant` has been
//! entered for other processes.
//!
//! The type `T` of a `Grant` is fixed in size. That is, when a `Grant` is
//! entered for a process the resulting allocated object will be the size of
//! `SizeOf<T>`. If capsules need additional process-specific memory for their
//! operation, they can use an `Allocator` to request additional memory from
//! the process's grant region.

                //
                // ## Explanation and Rationale
                //
                // This panic represents a tradeoff. While it is undesirable to
                // have the potential for a runtime crash in this grant region
                // code, it balances usability with type correctness. The
                // challenge is that calling `self.apps.iter()` is a common
                // pattern in capsules to access the grant region of every app
                // that is using the capsule, and sometimes it is intuitive to
                // call that inside of a `self.apps.enter(app_id, |app| {...})`
                // closure. However, `.enter()` means that app's grant region is
                // entered, and then a naive `.iter()` would re-enter the grant
                // region and cause undefined behavior. We considered different
                // options to resolve this.
                //
                // 1. Have `.iter()` only iterate over grant regions which are
                //    not entered. This avoids the bug, but could lead to
                //    unexpected behavior, as `self.apps.iter()` will do
                //    different things depending on where in a capsule it is
                //    called.
                // 2. Have the compiler detect when `.iter()` is called when a
                //    grant region has already been entered. We don't know of a
                //    viable way to implement this.
                // 3. Panic if `.iter()` is called when a grant is already
                //    entered.
                //
                // We decided on option 3 because it balances minimizing
                // surprises (`self.apps.iter()` will always iterate all grants)
                // while also protecting against the bug. We expect that any
                // code that attempts to call `self.apps.iter()` after calling
                // `.enter()` will immediately encounter this `panic!()` and
                // have to be refactored before any tests will be successful.
                // Therefore, this `panic!()` should only occur at
                // development/testing time.
                //
                // ## How to fix this error
                //
                // If you are seeing this panic, you need to refactor your
                // capsule to not call `.iter()` or `.each()` from inside a
                // `.enter()` closure. That is, you need to close the grant
                // region you are currently in before trying to iterate over all
                // grant regions.
