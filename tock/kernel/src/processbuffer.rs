//! Data structures for passing application memory to the kernel.
//!
//! A Tock process can pass read-write or read-only buffers into the
//! kernel for it to use. The kernel checks that read-write buffers
//! exist within a process's RAM address space, and that read-only
//! buffers exist either within its RAM or flash address space. These
//! buffers are shared with the allow_read_write() and
//! allow_read_only() system calls.
//!
//! A read-write and read-only call is mapped to the high-level Rust
//! types [`ReadWriteProcessBuffer`] and [`ReadOnlyProcessBuffer`]
//! respectively. The memory regions can be accessed through the
//! [`ReadableProcessBuffer`] and [`WriteableProcessBuffer`] traits,
//! implemented on the process buffer structs.
//!
//! Each access to the buffer structs requires a liveness check to ensure that the
//! process memory is still valid. For a more traditional interface, users can convert
//! buffers into [`ReadableProcessSlice`] or [`WriteableProcessSlice`] and use these
//! for the lifetime of their operations. Users cannot hold live-lived references to
//! these slices, however.
